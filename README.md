# Videogame launcher

Seamlessly launch videogames.

Currently supports launching Arcade, NES, SNES,
GameBoy, PlayStation, PlayStation 2 games.

It works cross-platform on GNU/Linux,
Android and Windows, so it is a dependency
of almost all the videogames published on the
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
uncensorable application store.

This program is written using the
[Crash Bash](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/crash-bash)
library.

## Usage

Help can be displayed by typing

```bash
videogame-launcher \
  -h
```

further informations are made available in
the manual.

```bash
man \
  videogame-launcher
```

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The launcher has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`videogame-launcher`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  videogame-launcher
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[videogame-launcher-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/videogame-launcher-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
